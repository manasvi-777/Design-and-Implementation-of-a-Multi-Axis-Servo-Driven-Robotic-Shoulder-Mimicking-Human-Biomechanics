This research presents the design and implementation of a robotic shoulder mechanism replicating human shoulder biomechanics using servo motors and an Arduino microcontroller. The three-degree-of-freedom (DOF) robotic arm performs human-like shoulder movements, including abduction, adduction, and circumduction. High-precision servo motors ensure accuracy, while a modular manipulator kit allows flexibility in structure and motion range. The Arduino-based control system provides real-time feedback and precise motion control. The study highlights the advantages of open-source platforms for cost-effective, adaptable robotic arms with applications in rehabilitation, prosthetics, and automation. Challenges like motor torque, weight distribution, and motion control are addressed, demonstrating the feasibility of microcontroller-driven robotic systems.
